## Bio

I am a postdoctoral scholar mentored by Professor [Rina Foygel Barber](https://rinafb.github.io/) at Department of Statistics, University of Chicago.

Prior to that, I completed my PhD in Statistics at Stanford University, jointly advised by Professor [John Duchi](https://web.stanford.edu/~jduchi/) and [Andrea Montanari](https://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/). I am fortunate to be a recipient of the [William R. Hewlett Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computational Mathematics from Peking University. 

<span style="color:gold; font-weight:bold;">I will start as an Assistant Professor in Statistics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, from Aug 2026. </span>

I'm broadly interested in mathematical theory and algorithms for high-dimensional data and statistical models. Over the years, I spanned over topics on high-dimensional statistics, statistical theory on machine learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning theory, and conformal prediction.
